#summary How to use rssmii
#labels Featured,Phase-Requirements,Phase-Deploy

= Getting started =
  # Extract the archive you downloaded to your SD-Card. The archive represents the root of the SD-Card.
  # Create a "feeds.xml" in the root of your SD-Card.

= The "feeds.xml" =
Here you see a sample-"feeds-xml"-file:
{{{
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<rss>
<feed url="http://example.com/rss-feed" name="Example-Feed" />
<feed url="http://example.com/another_rss-feed" name="One more Example-Feed!" />
</rss>
}}}
You can add as many feed-nodes as you want. The "name"-Attribute will be displayed on top of the message at the Wii-Messageboard, so it is recommended to cut that REALLY SHORT because there's hardly any space.

= Launching rssmii =
  # Launch rssmii in the Homebrew-Channel or any other launcher of your choice (I thought of custom channels, so launching this won't result in a CodeDump-Error on exit!)
  # You see the RSS-Feeds listed in the "feeds.xml"
  # When you now press A, every previous subscriptions to RSS-Feeds will be overwritten by subscriptions to the Feeds listed in the "feeds.xml".
  # Everything's finished - You should now be receiving updates at those RSS-Feeds at the Wii-Messageboard!
